# Subscribers to Joseph Williamson's Newsletter Service

This list was put together by the Networking Archives team. A list of subscribers drawn up by the letter office clerk Henry Ball, in October 1674, was the starting point. This list can be found in the National Archives state papers, SP 45/21 f. 64. A similar list can be found at SP 29/362 f. 24.

To this were added a number of subscribers additionally identified, who are not on this list either because they joined afterwards or had dropped off before the list was created. 

There are four fields: 

spo_id = the unique internal ID used by the Networking Archives project.

name = Name as it appears in State Papers Online or following disambiguation process.

service = newsletters were sent three times per week, and the service subscribed to by each was recorded by Ball in the list.

payment = record of payment, if any. Those who did not pay were usually either friends of Williamson or they promised to send a weekly letter of news to the office in return. 

Some names are repeated, as they signed up to multiple services.
