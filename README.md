# Subscribers to Joseph Williamson's Newsletter Service

This list was put together by the Networking Archives team. A list of subscribers drawn up by the letter office clerk Henry Ball, in October 1674, was the starting point. This list can be found in the National Archives state papers, SP 45/21 f. 64. A similar list can be found at SP 29/362 f. 24.

To this were added a number of subscribers additionally identified, who are not on this list either because they joined afterwards or had dropped off before the list was created.
